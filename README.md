# A Classic Memory Game
This is my version of the classic memory game.

# Game Logic
The game randomly shuffles the cards. A user wins once all cards have successfully been matched.

# Game Features

#### Restart Button
A restart button allows the player to reset the game board, the timer, and the star rating.

#### Star Rating
The game displays a star rating (from 1 to 3) that reflects the player's performance. At the beginning of a game, it displays 3 stars. After some number of moves, it changes to a lower star rating. After a few more moves, it changes to an even lower star rating (down to 1).

#### Timer
When the player starts a game, a displayed timer starts. Once the player wins the game, the timer stops.

#### Move Counter
Game displays the current number of moves a user has made.
